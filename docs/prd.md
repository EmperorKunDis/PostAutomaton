## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The application aims to provide a highly intuitive and efficient user experience for the marketing team. It should simplify complex content generation workflows, enabling users to quickly and accurately produce social media content tailored to specific company contexts and writer personas. The UX will prioritize clarity, control, and feedback, ensuring users feel empowered and confident in the AI-generated outputs.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

The core interaction paradigms will focus on:
* **Guided Workflow:** Leading the user step-by-step through the content generation process (company identification, writer profile selection, social network adaptation, blog post review, final generation).
* **Preview & Edit in Place:** Allowing users to review AI-generated content and make granular edits directly within the interface before finalization.
* **Configurability:** Providing clear, accessible options for customization (e.g., writer profiles, social network selection, frequency).
* **Feedback & Validation:** Offering immediate visual and textual feedback at each stage to confirm selections and AI outputs.

### Core Screens and Views

From a product perspective, the most critical screens or views necessary to deliver the PRD values and goals include:
* **Company Identification/Selection Screen:** For initial company input and validation.
* **Company Context & Writer Profile Configuration Screen:** Where users define/select writer personas and view company context.
* **Social Network & Adaptation Settings Screen:** For selecting platforms and defining per-writer preferences.
* **Blog Post Generation & Review Screen:** The primary interface for generating, outlining, and editing the long blog post.
* **Social Media Post Preview & Edit Screen:** For reviewing and fine-tuning individual social media posts across platforms and writers.
* **Content Library/Dashboard:** To manage generated content, view analytics, and access historical data.
* **Settings/Admin Panel:** For roles, permissions, LLM fine-tuning, and integration configurations.

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

### Branding

The application will adhere to our company's existing branding guidelines, including color palette, typography, and logo usage, to ensure a consistent visual identity with other internal tools.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

*Rationale: A monorepo structure will simplify code sharing between frontend and backend components (e.g., shared types, utility functions) and streamline full-stack development. This aligns with the integrated nature of the application, especially given the planned conversion from a long blog post to various social media formats.*

### Service Architecture

*Service Architecture: Hybrid (Monolith for Core LLM, Microservices/Serverless for External Integrations & Ancillary Services)*
*Rationale: The core on-premise LLM and content generation logic will likely benefit from a more monolithic, tightly coupled architecture for performance and localized control. External AI integrations and potentially other ancillary services (e.g., analytics processing, social media posting integrations) can be implemented as smaller, decoupled microservices or serverless functions to ensure flexibility, scalability, and independent deployment without impacting the core LLM. This balances the need for robust core functionality with the agility for external integrations.*

### Testing Requirements

*Testing Requirements: Full Testing Pyramid (Unit + Integration + E2E + Manual testing convenience methods)*
*Rationale: Given the critical nature of content accuracy, brand compliance, and integration with multiple external APIs, a comprehensive testing strategy is essential. Unit tests will validate individual components, integration tests will confirm seamless data flow between internal and external services, and E2E tests will ensure the entire user journey functions as expected. Manual testing convenience methods will support the human-in-the-loop review processes.*

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

* **Language & Runtime:** TypeScript with Node.js for backend services due to its prevalence in modern full-stack development and strong typing benefits. For the on-premise LLM, the choice of language/framework will be dictated by the specific open-source model chosen (e.g., Python for many ML frameworks).
* **Database:** A flexible, scalable database solution will be needed to store blog content, social posts, user configurations, and analytics data. A NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB, DynamoDB) could offer schema flexibility suitable for varying content structures, while a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) might be preferred for structured user and analytics data. A hybrid approach could also be considered.
* **API Communication:** Internal API communication between frontend and backend will likely be RESTful or gRPC for efficient data exchange.
* **Authentication:** A secure authentication mechanism will be required for internal marketing team users.
* **Hosting/Infrastructure:** Cloud platform (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) for hosting frontend, backend services, external integrations, and potentially supporting the on-premise LLM's infrastructure needs (GPU instances etc.).

7.2: The system performs automated plagiarism detection on generated content.
7.3: The system performs automated fact-checking against external knowledge bases for factual accuracy.
7.4: The system conducts sentiment analysis to ensure the tone of the generated content is safe and appropriate.
7.5: The system ensures a "human-in-the-loop" review process is mandatory before content can be published, allowing for human oversight and approval of ethical considerations.
7.6: The system maintains transparent audit logs of all content generation and validation steps for accountability.

## Epic 8: Security, Privacy & Automation Integration

**Epic Goal:** Ensure robust security and data privacy measures are in place, particularly for handling sensitive data with external AI models, and establish the N8N API/webhook integration for broader automation.

**Story 8.1: Data Privacy & Secure Handling for External AI**

As an **administrator**,
I want the **system to ensure data privacy and secure handling of company data, especially when interacting with external AI models**,
so that **sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access or exposure**.

**Acceptance Criteria**
8.1: The system implements a separate secure layer for private company data, distinct from publicly accessible research data.
8.2: The system uses pseudonymized queries for all external API calls to third-party AI models (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT), stripping sensitive data (e.g., customer names, unreleased products).
8.3: The system logs all external queries for audit and review purposes.
8.4: The system ensures all data handling processes are compliant with GDPR regulations.
8.5: The system implements clear data retention policies for all stored data.
8.6: The system provides role-based access control (RBAC) to company data based on user permissions.
8.7: (Optional Future Feature): The system supports bring-your-own-key encryption for enhanced data security.

**Story 8.2: Internal Security Measures & Access Control**

As an **administrator**,

so that **our company's content and data integrity are maintained**.

**Acceptance Criteria**
8.1: The system employs secure authentication protocols for user logins.
8.2: All data in transit within the internal network is encrypted.
8.3: The system logs all user activities, including content generation, modifications, and access, for audit purposes.
8.4: The system implements measures to prevent SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other common web vulnerabilities.
8.5: The on-premise LLM and its associated data are protected by appropriate network and server security configurations.

**Story 8.3: N8N Automation Integration**

so that I can **integrate the content generation process with our N8N automation server and other marketing tools**.

**Acceptance Criteria**
8.1: The system exposes API endpoints for triggering content publication actions (e.g., publishing a social post).
8.2: The system provides configurable webhooks to notify N8N of key events (e.g., new blog post approved, social post generated, analytics report ready).
8.3: The API outputs and webhooks are well-documented for easy integration with N8N and other third-party tools.
8.4: The system ensures secure authentication for API and webhook access.
8.5: The system allows for flexible configuration of webhook payloads to include relevant content and metadata.
