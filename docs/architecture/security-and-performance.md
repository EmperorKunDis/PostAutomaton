# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

This section outlines the critical security measures to be implemented across the application.

  * **Frontend Security:**
      * **CSP Headers:** Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to mitigate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other content injection attacks.
      * **XSS Prevention:** Ensure all user-generated content and data displayed in the UI is properly sanitized and escaped to prevent XSS vulnerabilities. Use React's built-in protections and sanitize any `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` usage.
      * **Secure Storage:** Avoid storing sensitive user information (e.g., authentication tokens, personal data) directly in local storage. Utilize HttpOnly cookies for session tokens or in-memory storage for short-lived, non-sensitive data.
  * **Backend Security:**
      * **Input Validation:** All incoming API requests and user inputs must undergo strict server-side validation to prevent injection attacks (SQL Injection, NoSQL Injection) and ensure data integrity. Use a validation library (e.g., class-validator for NestJS).
      * **Rate Limiting:** Implement API rate limiting to protect against brute-force attacks and denial-ofservice (DoS) attempts on frequently accessed endpoints.
      * **CORS Policy:** Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies to allow only trusted origins to access the backend API.
      * **HTTPS Enforcement:** Enforce HTTPS for all communication between frontend and backend, and with external APIs, to ensure data encryption in transit.
  * **Authentication Security:**
      * **Token Storage:** Store authentication tokens (e.g., JWTs) securely. For browser-based applications, HttpOnly, Secure cookies are preferred over local storage to mitigate XSS risks.
      * **Session Management:** Implement robust session management, including token expiration, refresh tokens, and server-side invalidation.
      * **Password Policy:** If local password authentication is used, enforce strong password policies (complexity, length) and securely hash passwords using industry-standard algorithms (e.g., bcrypt).

## Performance Optimization

This section outlines strategies to ensure the application remains fast and responsive.

  * **Frontend Performance:**
      * **Bundle Size Target:** Aim to keep the JavaScript bundle size optimized by using tree-shaking, code splitting, and lazy loading for routes and components.
      * **Loading Strategy:** Implement lazy loading for non-critical assets and features to improve initial page load times. Use React's `lazy` and `Suspense`.
      * **Caching Strategy:** Leverage browser caching for static assets (JavaScript, CSS, images). Implement service workers for more advanced caching and offline capabilities if required.
  * **Backend Performance:**
      * **Response Time Target:** Aim for API response times of less than 200ms for critical endpoints.
      * **Database Optimization:** Optimize database queries through proper indexing, query optimization, and efficient data access patterns (e.g., using the Repository Pattern). Implement connection pooling.
      * **Caching Strategy:** Utilize Redis for caching frequently accessed data (e.g., database query results, computed values) to reduce database load and improve API response times.
