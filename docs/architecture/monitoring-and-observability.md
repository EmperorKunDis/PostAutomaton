# Monitoring and Observability

## Monitoring Stack

Our monitoring strategy will leverage the **Prometheus & Grafana** stack for collecting and visualizing metrics, and the **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** for centralized logging.

  * **Frontend Monitoring:**
      * **Tooling:** Integrated with Prometheus for custom application metrics (e.g., component render times, API call durations from the user's perspective). Error tracking via **Sentry** (or similar solution) for client-side errors and performance issues (Core Web Vitals).
      * **Purpose:** To track user experience, client-side performance, and JavaScript errors.
  * **Backend Monitoring:**
      * **Tooling:** Prometheus for system and application metrics (CPU, memory, request rates, response times, database query performance). Grafana for dashboards.
      * **Purpose:** To monitor service health, API performance, resource utilization, and identify bottlenecks.
  * **On-Premise LLM Monitoring:**
      * **Tooling:** Prometheus exporters for the LLM service (e.g., Python application metrics, GPU utilization, inference latency).
      * **Purpose:** To track LLM performance, resource consumption, and availability.
  * **Error Tracking:** **Sentry** (for frontend errors) and ELK (for backend errors) will capture and centralize all application errors, providing detailed stack traces and context.
  * **Performance Monitoring (APM):** Consider integrating an Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tool (e.g., **Jaeger for distributed tracing** for complex backend interactions, or **New Relic/Datadog** if a commercial solution is preferred) to get deeper insights into transaction flows and latency across services.

## Key Metrics

We will define key metrics for both frontend and backend to provide a comprehensive view of application health and performance.

  * **Frontend Metrics:**
      * **Core Web Vitals:** Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) for perceived loading performance, interactivity, and visual stability.
      * **JavaScript errors:** Number and rate of uncaught JavaScript errors.
      * **API response times (client-side):** Latency of API calls from the user's browser.
      * **User interactions:** Custom events for critical user actions (e.g., successful content generation, export completions).
      * **Bundle Size:** Track the size of loaded JavaScript and CSS bundles.
  * **Backend Metrics:**
      * **Request rate:** Number of requests per second for key API endpoints.
      * **Error rate:** Percentage of requests resulting in server errors (5xx).
      * **Response time:** Average and percentile (e.g., P95, P99) latency for API responses.
      * **Database query performance:** Latency and success rate of database operations.
      * **Resource utilization:** CPU, memory, disk I/O, network I/O for VMs/containers.
      * **LLM inference latency:** Time taken for the on-premise LLM to generate content.
      * **External AI API call success/failure rate:** Monitoring of third-party service reliability.
