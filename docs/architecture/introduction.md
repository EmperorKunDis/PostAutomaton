# Introduction

## Intro Content

This document outlines the overall project architecture for the Internal Marketing Content App, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack. This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

I have reviewed the PRD and brainstorming brief for any mentions of starter templates or existing codebases. Based on the information, it appears this is a Greenfield project with no specific starter template mentioned.

Therefore, we will proceed with architecture design from scratch, noting that all tooling, bundling, and configuration will need manual setup.
