# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The application aims to provide a highly intuitive and efficient user experience for the marketing team. It should simplify complex content generation workflows, enabling users to quickly and accurately produce social media content tailored to specific company contexts and writer personas. The UX will prioritize clarity, control, and feedback, ensuring users feel empowered and confident in the AI-generated outputs.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

The core interaction paradigms will focus on:
* **Guided Workflow:** Leading the user step-by-step through the content generation process (company identification, writer profile selection, social network adaptation, blog post review, final generation).
* **Preview & Edit in Place:** Allowing users to review AI-generated content and make granular edits directly within the interface before finalization.
* **Configurability:** Providing clear, accessible options for customization (e.g., writer profiles, social network selection, frequency).
* **Feedback & Validation:** Offering immediate visual and textual feedback at each stage to confirm selections and AI outputs.

## Core Screens and Views

From a product perspective, the most critical screens or views necessary to deliver the PRD values and goals include:
* **Company Identification/Selection Screen:** For initial company input and validation.
* **Company Context & Writer Profile Configuration Screen:** Where users define/select writer personas and view company context.
* **Social Network & Adaptation Settings Screen:** For selecting platforms and defining per-writer preferences.
* **Blog Post Generation & Review Screen:** The primary interface for generating, outlining, and editing the long blog post.
* **Social Media Post Preview & Edit Screen:** For reviewing and fine-tuning individual social media posts across platforms and writers.
* **Content Library/Dashboard:** To manage generated content, view analytics, and access historical data.
* **Settings/Admin Panel:** For roles, permissions, LLM fine-tuning, and integration configurations.
