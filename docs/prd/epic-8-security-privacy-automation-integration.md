# Epic 8: Security, Privacy & Automation Integration

**Epic Goal:** Ensure robust security and data privacy measures are in place, particularly for handling sensitive data with external AI models, and establish the N8N API/webhook integration for broader automation.

**Story 8.1: Data Privacy & Secure Handling for External AI**

As an **administrator**,
I want the **system to ensure data privacy and secure handling of company data, especially when interacting with external AI models**,
so that **sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access or exposure**.

**Acceptance Criteria**
8.1: The system implements a separate secure layer for private company data, distinct from publicly accessible research data.
8.2: The system uses pseudonymized queries for all external API calls to third-party AI models (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT), stripping sensitive data (e.g., customer names, unreleased products).
8.3: The system logs all external queries for audit and review purposes.
8.4: The system ensures all data handling processes are compliant with GDPR regulations.
8.5: The system implements clear data retention policies for all stored data.
8.6: The system provides role-based access control (RBAC) to company data based on user permissions.
8.7: (Optional Future Feature): The system supports bring-your-own-key encryption for enhanced data security.

**Story 8.2: Internal Security Measures & Access Control**

As an **administrator**,
I want the **internal application to be secure against unauthorized access and internal threats**,
so that **our company's content and data integrity are maintained**.

**Acceptance Criteria**
8.1: The system employs secure authentication protocols for user logins.
8.2: All data in transit within the internal network is encrypted.
8.3: The system logs all user activities, including content generation, modifications, and access, for audit purposes.
8.4: The system implements measures to prevent SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other common web vulnerabilities.
8.5: The on-premise LLM and its associated data are protected by appropriate network and server security configurations.

**Story 8.3: N8N Automation Integration**

As a **marketing operations specialist**,
I want the **system to provide API outputs or webhooks for content publication and data triggers**,
so that I can **integrate the content generation process with our N8N automation server and other marketing tools**.

**Acceptance Criteria**
8.1: The system exposes API endpoints for triggering content publication actions (e.g., publishing a social post).
8.2: The system provides configurable webhooks to notify N8N of key events (e.g., new blog post approved, social post generated, analytics report ready).
8.3: The API outputs and webhooks are well-documented for easy integration with N8N and other third-party tools.
8.4: The system ensures secure authentication for API and webhook access.
8.5: The system allows for flexible configuration of webhook payloads to include relevant content and metadata.
