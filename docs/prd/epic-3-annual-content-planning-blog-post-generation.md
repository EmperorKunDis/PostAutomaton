# Epic 3: Annual Content Planning & Blog Post Generation

**Epic Goal:** Develop the functionality for generating a year's worth of content topics, and for creating comprehensive, multi-page blog posts based on company context and writer profiles, including the user review and editing capabilities for the blog structure.

**Story 3.1: Annual Content Topic Generation**

As a **marketing team member**,
I want the **system to generate post topics for a year in advance**,

**Acceptance Criteria**
3.1: The system generates a list of post topics for a 12-month period.
3.2: Topic generation is guided by company context (industry, products, values, target audience), selected writer profiles, industry trends (pulled from external sources), and seasonality (holidays, industry events, product cycles).
3.3: The system ensures variety and avoids topic repetition by rotating through themes (e.g., product, behind-the-scenes, team, insights, testimonials).
3.4: The system incorporates keyword research/SEO suggestions for blog topics.
3.5: The system aligns topics with user goals (e.g., brand awareness, recruitment, thought leadership, product promotion).
3.6: The annual plan template includes room for dynamic/real-time updates.

**Story 3.2: Long Blog Post Generation from Topic**

As a **marketing team member**,
I want the **system to generate a long, comprehensive blog post (5-6 A4 pages) based on a selected topic and writer profile**,
so that I can **have the foundational content for all social media adaptations**.

**Acceptance Criteria**

3.2: The system generates a detailed outline for the blog post, including key sections and their goals.

**Story 3.3: Granular Blog Post Structure Review & Editing**

As a **marketing team member**,
I want to **review and edit the blog post's generated structure at a paragraph/section level**,
so that I can **ensure the content aligns exactly with my intent and tone before finalization**.

**Acceptance Criteria**
3.1: The system displays the blog post outline with labels for each paragraph/section (e.g., "Paragraph 1: Introduction to challenge," "Paragraph 2: Case study/example," "Paragraph 3: Key insight + takeaway").
3.2: Users can rewrite, delete, or regenerate content for any individual paragraph or section.
3.3: "Approve" and "Edit" options are available for each section.
