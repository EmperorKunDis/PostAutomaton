# Epic 7: LLM Training & Ethical AI Guardrails

**Epic Goal:** Implement the mechanisms for training/onboarding the on-premise LLM with internal data and brand guidelines, and integrate ethical AI guardrails like content validation rules and bias detection.

**Story 7.1: LLM Brand & Tone Fine-Tuning**

As an **administrator**,
I want to **fine-tune the on-premise LLM with our company's specific brand guidelines and tone-of-voice**,
so that **all generated content consistently reflects our brand identity**.

**Acceptance Criteria**
7.1: The system provides an interface to upload brand guidelines, tone-of-voice documents, and messaging playbooks for the on-premise LLM.
7.2: The system allows for the provision of example content (blog posts, emails, social content) to further train or fine-tune the LLM.
7.3: The system utilizes structured prompt templates that enforce desired tone, formatting, and key messaging during content generation.
7.4: The system supports Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to combine real-time knowledge with brand documents for improved content relevance and accuracy.
7.5: (Optional Future Feature): The system provides functionality to fine-tune open-source models (e.g., Mistral, LLaMA) with internal, labeled data, with clear instructions for evaluation.

**Story 7.2: Content Validation Rules Implementation**

As a **marketing manager**,
I want the **system to enforce content validation rules**,
so that **generated content adheres to our internal standards and avoids inappropriate language**.

**Acceptance Criteria**
7.1: The system allows administrators to define and manage content validation rules (e.g., banned words list, required disclaimers).
7.2: The system automatically flags or prevents content generation that violates defined validation rules.
7.3: The system enforces tone requirements via prompts and templates during content generation.
7.4: The system provides clear feedback to the user when content fails validation rules, explaining the reason for the violation.

**Story 7.3: Bias Detection & Ethical Content Review**

As a **marketing team member**,
I want the **system to help detect and mitigate bias in AI-generated content**,
so that **all content is accurate, unbiased, and ethically sound**.

**Acceptance Criteria**
7.1: The system integrates bias detection algorithms to flag potentially discriminatory, overly assertive, or off-brand phrasing in generated content.
7.2: The system performs automated plagiarism detection on generated content.
7.3: The system performs automated fact-checking against external knowledge bases for factual accuracy.
7.4: The system conducts sentiment analysis to ensure the tone of the generated content is safe and appropriate.
7.5: The system ensures a "human-in-the-loop" review process is mandatory before content can be published, allowing for human oversight and approval of ethical considerations.
7.6: The system maintains transparent audit logs of all content generation and validation steps for accountability.
