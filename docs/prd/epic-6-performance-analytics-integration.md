# Epic 6: Performance & Analytics Integration

**Epic Goal:** Establish API integrations with social platforms for performance metrics, enable UTM tagging for blog content, and develop the dashboard for content performance analytics.

**Story 6.1: Social Media Platform API Integrations for Analytics**

As a **marketing team member**,
I want the **system to integrate with social media platform APIs**,
so that I can **automatically retrieve post-level performance metrics for analysis**.

**Acceptance Criteria**
6.1: The system establishes secure API integrations with LinkedIn, Meta (Facebook/Instagram), and X (Twitter) for analytics data retrieval.
6.2: The system can retrieve key engagement metrics per post and platform (e.g., likes, comments, shares, clicks).
6.3: The system can retrieve post reach and impression data.
6.4: The system can retrieve follower growth data correlated with post frequency or topics.
6.5: The system handles API rate limits and authentication tokens for continuous data retrieval.
6.6: (Consideration): The system utilizes URL shortening services (e.g., Bitly, Rebrandly) for tracking click performance where direct API insights are limited.

**Story 6.2: UTM Tagging & Google Analytics Integration**

As a **marketing team member**,
I want the **system to automatically apply UTM tags to all blog content links**
so that I can **track blog traffic and performance accurately in Google Analytics**.

**Acceptance Criteria**
6.1: The system automatically generates and applies UTM tags (source, medium, campaign) to all links within generated blog posts that lead back to internal company assets or landing pages.
6.2: Users can view and, if necessary, customize the default UTM tagging parameters.
6.3: The system supports integration with Google Analytics for reporting on blog content performance based on UTM data.

**Story 6.3: Content Performance Dashboard**

As a **marketing team member**,
I want to **view content performance data in an interactive dashboard**,
so that I can **understand what content resonates best and optimize my strategy**.

**Acceptance Criteria**
6.1: The system displays a dashboard visualizing key content performance metrics (engagement rate, follower growth, reach, impressions).
6.2: The dashboard allows filtering and segmentation of data by platform, writer profile, topic, and content category.
6.3: The dashboard identifies best-performing content categories based on defined metrics.
6.4: The dashboard presents trends over time for key metrics.
6.5: (Optional Future Integration): The dashboard can display lead tracking data from integrated CRM systems (e.g., HubSpot, Pipedrive) if configured.
