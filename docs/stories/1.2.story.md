## Story Details
**Story ID**: 1.2  
**Epic**: Epic 1 - Core Application Foundation  
**Status**: InProgress  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Points**: 8  
**Assigned To**: Development Team  

## User Story
**As a** marketing team member  
**I want to** search for and select my company with intelligent identification  
**So that** the system can generate content with accurate company context

## Description
Implement the company identification and selection functionality that allows users to search for their company, validates the selection through intelligent matching, and handles ambiguous cases. This includes building a company search interface, displaying company cards with relevant details, and providing manual entry options when companies aren't found.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **AC 1.1**: User can input company name in a search interface
   - Search box with autocomplete suggestions
   - Real-time search as user types (debounced)
   - Clear visual feedback during search

2. **AC 1.2**: System performs intelligent company identification
   - Searches through company database/mock data
   - Uses fuzzy matching for partial names
   - Considers user context (location, industry hints)

3. **AC 1.3**: Company cards display relevant information
   - Company name and logo placeholder
   - Location (city, country)
   - Industry classification
   - Brief description
   - Confidence score for matches

4. **AC 1.4**: Handle ambiguous company names
   - Display multiple matches when name is ambiguous
   - Sort by relevance/confidence score
   - Allow user to select correct company
   - Maximum 5 suggestions shown

5. **AC 1.5**: Manual company entry option
   - "Company not listed?" option
   - Form for manual company details:
     - Company name (required)
     - Industry (dropdown selection)
     - Location (city, country)
     - Website URL (optional)
     - Brief description (optional)

6. **AC 1.6**: Company context confirmation
   - Selected company details shown for confirmation
   - "This is my company" confirmation button
   - "Search again" option to restart

## Technical Context

### Frontend Components Needed
- `CompanySearch`: Main search interface component
- `CompanyCard`: Display component for company information
- `CompanySuggestions`: List of matching companies
- `ManualCompanyForm`: Form for manual entry
- `CompanyConfirmation`: Final confirmation screen

### Backend Endpoints Required
- `GET /api/companies/search?q={query}`: Search companies
- `GET /api/companies/{id}`: Get company details
- `POST /api/companies`: Create manual company entry
- `GET /api/companies/suggestions`: Get suggestions based on context

### Data Models
```typescript
interface Company {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  logo?: string;
  location: {
    city: string;
    country: string;
  };
  industry: string;
  description?: string;
  website?: string;
  confidence?: number; // For search results
}

interface CompanySearchResult {
  companies: Company[];
  totalCount: number;
  searchQuery: string;
}
```

### State Management
- Company search state (query, results, loading)
- Selected company state
- Manual entry form state
- Navigation flow state

## Dependencies
- Story 1.1 (Authentication) must be completed
- Company data source (mock data for MVP)
- Search/matching algorithm implementation

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Unit tests written (80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Component tests for UI elements
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Responsive design implemented
- [ ] Accessibility standards met (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Performance: Search results < 500ms
- [ ] Manual tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari

## Notes
- For MVP, use mock company data instead of real API
- Consider implementing Redis cache for search results
- Future enhancement: Integration with business registries
- Logo display can use placeholder images initially

## Mockups/Wireframes
[Placeholder for design mockups]

## Test Scenarios
1. Search for exact company name match
2. Search for partial company name
3. Search with typos (fuzzy matching)
4. Select from ambiguous results
5. Manual entry flow completion
6. Confirmation and navigation flow
7. Error states (no results, API failure)
8. Loading states during search
